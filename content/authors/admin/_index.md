Hi, I am Zhang Minhang, a third-year master student from Tianjin University. 

My research focus on the simulation of gas-liquid-liquid multiphase flow in mixing equipment. Also, I have a collaborative project with my classmates, which involves thermal field simulation of thermal conductive materials in practical scenarios.
