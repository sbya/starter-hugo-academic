Majoring in chemical engineering, my main research area during my master's degree is multiphase flow CFD simulation. It involves basic knowledge of computational fluid dynamics, multiphase flow and rotating machinery. In addition, I have a collaborative project with my classmates, which focuses on the effect of the structure of a thermally conductive material on heat dissipation and the thermal conductivity of that material in different practical scenarios.

I have been using MATLAB for data analysis, such as nonlinear fitting and Fast Fourier Transform, during my undergraduate and master's degree. I also have a strong interest in programming and I am currently learning C++ and trying to develop a CFD solver.
